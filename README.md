Drawing on the computer screen using hand gestures. 

You need to give camera access to the app. Then it will detect your hand.


Some important instructions:

One finger signifies that you want to draw or erase something.

Two finger signifies that you want to select some color or erase.

That's all..Its quite simple but very cool app. Enjoy..

Note: Currently there are only 3 colors available - Red, Green and Blue.
